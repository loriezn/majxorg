# Personal online presence aggregator

This is an app that uses background fetchers to aggregate my online presence on sites such as
Google Latitude, Flickr, Tumblr, Last.fm and Pinboard.

It's running on Heroku's free tier, and uses [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) for the background fetching.
